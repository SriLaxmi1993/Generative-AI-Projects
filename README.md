Got it 👍 — thanks for flagging.
You’re right: **no file was actually created yet**. Let’s fix this cleanly.

Below is a **complete `README.md` you can copy-paste directly into your repo root** (`Generative-AI-Projects/README.md`).
It is **beginner-friendly**, explains **what this repo is**, **how to use it**, and **what each folder teaches**, based on the screenshot you shared.
